AIMET TensorFlow Quantization APIs
==================================

AIMET Quantization for TensorFlow provides the following functionality
   - :ref:`Quantization Simulation<tf-quantsim>`: Allows ability to simulate inference and training on quantized hardware
   - :ref:`Cross-Layer Equalization<tf-cle>`: Post-training quantization technique to equalize layer parameters
   - :ref:`Bias Correction<tf-bias-correction>`: Post-training quantization technique to correct shift in layer outputs due to quantization noise
