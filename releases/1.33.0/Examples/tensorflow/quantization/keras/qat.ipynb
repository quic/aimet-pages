    "# Quantization-Aware Training\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows a working code example of how to use AIMET to perform Quantization Aware Training(QAT). QAT is an AIMET feature adding quantization simulation ops to a pre-trained model and using a standard training pipeline to fine-tune the model for a few epochs. The resulting model should show improved accuracy on quantized ML accelerators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantization parameters(like encoding min/max/scale/offset) for activations are computed once. During fine-tuning, the model weights are updated to minimize the effects of quantization in the forward pass, keeping the quantization parameters constant.\n",

    "#### Overall flow\n",
    "This notebook covers the following\n",
    "1. Instantiate the example evaluation and training pipeline\n",
    "2. Load a pretrained FP32 model and determine the baseline FP32 accuracy\n",
    "3. Create a quantization simulation model (with fake quantization ops inserted) and evaluate this simulation model to get a quantized accuracy score\n",
    "4. Fine-tune the quantization simulation model using QAT and evaluate the simulation model to get a post fine-tuned quantized accuracy score\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What this notebook is not\n",
    "* This notebook is not designed to show state-of-the-art QAT results. For example, it uses a relatively quantization-friendly model like Resnet50. Also, some optimization parameters like number of epochs are deliberately chosen to have the notebook execute more quickly."

Doing so, results in an inferences/sec speedup since unnecessary computation is avoided. Now from a floating point compute perspective, a BN-folded model is mathematically equivalent to a model with BN layers from an inference perspective, and produces the same accuracy. However, folding the BN layers can increase the range of the tensor values for the weight parameters of the adjacent layers. And this can have a negative impact on the quantized accuracy of the model (especially when using INT8 or lower precision). So, we want to simulate that on-target behavior by doing BN folding here.\n",

    "### Compute Encodings\n",
    "Even though AIMET has wrapped the layers to act as being 'quantized' but the model is not ready to be used yet. Before we can use the sim model for inference or training, we need to find appropriate scale/offset quantization parameters for each 'quantizer' layer. For activation quantization layers, we need to pass unlabeled data samples through the model to collect range statistics which will then let AIMET calculate appropriate scale/offset quantization parameters. This process is sometimes referred to as calibration. AIMET simply refers to it as 'computing encodings'.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we create a routine to pass unlabeled data samples through the model. This should be fairly simple - use the existing train or validation data loader to extract some samples and pass them to the model. We don't need to compute any loss metric etc. So we can just ignore the model output for this purpose. A few pointers regarding the data samples\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we need a very small percentage of the overall data samples for computing encodings. For example, the training dataset for ImageNet has 1M samples. For computing encodings we only need 500 or 1000 samples.\n",
    "It may be beneficial if the samples used for computing encoding are well distributed. It's not necessary that all classes need to be covered etc. since we are only looking at the range of values at every layer activation. However, we definitely want to avoid an extreme scenario like all 'dark' or 'light' samples are used - e.g. only using pictures captured at night might not give ideal results.\n",
