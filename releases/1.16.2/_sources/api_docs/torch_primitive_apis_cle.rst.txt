====================================================
AIMET PyTorch Cross Layer Equalization Primitive API
====================================================

Introduction
============

If a user wants to modify the order of Cross Layer equalization, not use some features or manually tweak the list of
layers that need to be equalized, the following APIs can be used.

Higher level APIs can be used for using one or more features one after the other. It automatically finds the layers to
be folded or scaled.

Lower level APIs can be used to manually tweak the list of layers to be folded. The user has to pass the list of
layers in the correct order that they appear in the model.

Note: Before using High Bias fold, Cross Layer Scaling (CLS) needs to be applied and scaling factors obtained from
CLS need to be plugged in to High Bias Fold. And, if there are batchnorm layers, they need to be folded and the info
saved to be plugged into high bias fold API.
