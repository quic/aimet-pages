    "First, we will create a Keras model with subclass layers. For this notebook example, we will use a model defined by Keras that utilizes subclass layers. This model is a text classification transformer model and can be found [here]( https://keras.io/examples/nlp/text_classification_with_transformer/). The subclass layers used in this model are - `TokenAndPositionEmbedding` and `TransformerBlock`. They are defined below. "
