    "# Adaptive Rounding (Adaround)\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the use of AIMET Adaround feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "AIMET quantization features, by default, use the \"nearest rounding\" technique for achieving quantization. When using the \"nearest rounding\" technique, the weight value is quantized to the nearest integer value. The Adaptive Rounding (AdaRound) feature, uses a smaller subset of the unlabelled training data to adaptively round the weights. AdaRound, optimizes a loss function using the unlabelled training data to adaptively decide whether to quantize a specific weight to the integer value near it or away from it. Using the AdaRound quantization, a model is able to achieve an accuracy closer to the FP32 model, while using low bit-width integer quantization.\n",

    "4. Apply Adaround and evaluate the simulation model to get a post-finetuned quantized accuracy score\n",

    "#### What this notebook is not\n",
    "* This notebook is not designed to show state-of-the-art results. For example, it uses a relatively quantization-friendly model like Resnet50. Also, some optimization parameters are deliberately chosen to have the notebook execute more quickly."

Doing so, results in an inferences/sec speedup since unnecessary computation is avoided. Now from a floating point compute perspective, a BN-folded model is mathematically equivalent to a model with BN layers from an inference perspective, and produces the same accuracy. However, folding the BN layers can increase the range of the tensor values for the weight parameters of the adjacent layers. And this can have a negative impact on the quantized accuracy of the model (especially when using INT8 or lower precision). So, we want to simulate that on-target behavior by doing BN folding here.\n",

Before we can use the sim model for inference or training, we need to find appropriate scale/offset quantization parameters for each 'quantizer' node. For activation quantization nodes, we need to pass unlabeled data samples through the model to collect range statistics which will then let AIMET calculate appropriate scale/offset quantization parameters. This process is sometimes referred to as calibration. AIMET simply refers to it as 'computing encodings'.\n",
