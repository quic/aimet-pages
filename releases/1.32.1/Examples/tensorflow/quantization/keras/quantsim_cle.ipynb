    "# Cross-Layer Equalization (CLE) with QuantSim\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases a working code example of how to use AIMET to apply Cross-Layer Equalization (CLE) and use QuantSim. CLE is post-training quantization techniques that aims to improve quantized accuracy of a given model. CLE does not need any data samples. This technique help recover quantized accuracy when the model quantization is sensitive to parameter quantization as opposed to activation quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about this techniques, please refer to the \"Data-Free Quantization Through Weight Equalization and Bias Correction\" paper from ICCV 2019 - https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04721\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-Layer Equalization**\n",
    "AIMET performs the following steps when running CLE:\n",
    "1. Batch Norm Folding: Folds BN layers into Conv layers immediate before or after the Conv layers.\n",
    "2. Cross-Layer Scaling: Given a set of consecutive Conv layers, equalizes the range of tensor values per-channel by scaling up/down per-channel weight tensor values of a layer and corresponding scaling down/up per-channel weight tensor values of the subsequent layer.\n",
    "3. High Bias Folding: Cross-layer scaling may result in high bias parameter values for some layers. This technique folds some of the bias of a layer into the subsequent layer's parameters.\n",

    "#### Overall flow\n",
    "This notebook covers the following\n",
    "1. Instantiate the example evaluation and training pipeline\n",
    "2. Load the FP32 model and evaluate the model to find the baseline FP32 accuracy\n",
    "3. Create a quantization simulation model (with fake quantization ops inserted) and evaluate this simuation model to get a quantized accuracy score\n",

Doing so, results in an inferences/sec speedup since unnecessary computation is avoided. Now from a floating point compute perspective, a BN-folded model is mathematically equivalent to a model with BN layers from an inference perspective, and produces the same accuracy. However, folding the BN layers can increase the range of the tensor values for the weight parameters of the adjacent layers. And this can have a negative impact on the quantized accuracy of the model (especially when using INT8 or lower precision). So, we want to simulate that on-target behavior by doing BN folding here.\n",

    "Even though AIMET has wrapped the layers to act as being 'quantized' but the model is not ready to be used yet. Before we can use the sim model for inference or training, we need to find appropriate scale/offset quantization parameters for each 'quantizer' layer. For activation quantization layers, we need to pass unlabeled data samples through the model to collect range statistics which will then let AIMET calculate appropriate scale/offset quantization parameters. This process is sometimes referred to as calibration. AIMET simply refers to it as 'computing encodings'.\n",

This should be fairly simple - use the existing train or validation data loader to extract some samples and pass them to the model.

It's not necessary that all classes need to be covered etc. since we are only looking at the range of values at every layer activation.
