    "This notebook covers the following\n",
    "1. Instantiate the example evaluation pipeline\n",
    "2. Load the FP32 model\n",
    "3. Apply QuantAnalyzer to the model\n",

    "QuantAnalyzer performs the following analysis:\n",
    "1. model sensitivity to weight and activation quantization\n",

    "* For example, it uses a relatively quantization-friendly model like Resnet18.\n",
