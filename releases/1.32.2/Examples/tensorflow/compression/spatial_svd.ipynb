    "# Model compression Using Spatial SVD \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows a working code example of how to use AIMET to perform model compression. The Spatial SVD technique is used in this notebook to achieve model compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief introduction to the techniques. Please refer to the AIMET user guide for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spatial SVD**: This is a tensor-decomposition technique generally applied to convolutional layers (Conv2D). Applying this technique will decompose a single convolutional layer into two. The weight tensor of the layer to be split is flattended to a 2D matrix and singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to this matrix. Compression is achieved by discarding the least significant singular values in the diagonal matrix. The decomposed matrices are combined back into two separate convolutional layers.\n",
    "2. **Channel Pruning**: In this technique AIMET will discard least significant (using a magnitude metric) input channels of a given convolutional (Conv2D) layer. The layers of the model feeding into this convolutional layer also have the channels dimension modified to get back to a working graph. This technique also uses a layer-by-layer reconstruction procedure that modifies the weights of the compressed layers to minimize the distance of the compressed layer output to the corresponding layer output of the original model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of the above techniques are structured pruning techniques that aim to reduce computational macs or memory requirements of the model. Subsequent to applying either of these techniques, the compressed model needs to be fine-tuned (meaning trained again for a few epochs) to recover accuracy close to the original model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows working code example of how the technique #1 can be used to compress the model. You can find a separate notebook for #2, and #1 followed by #2 in the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall flow\n",
    "This notebook covers the following\n",
    "1. Instantiate the example evaluation and training pipeline\n",
    "2. Load the model and evaluate it to find the baseline accuracy\n",
    "3. Compress the model and fine-tune:  \n",
    "    3.1 Compress model using Spatial SVD and evaluate it to find post-compression accuracy  \n",
    "    3.2 Fine-tune the model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What this notebook is not \n",
    "* This notebook is not designed to show state-of-the-art compression results. For example, some optimization parameters such as num_comp_ratio_candidates, num_eval_iterations and epochs are deliberately chosen to have the notebook execute more quickly.\n"

E.g. the entire ILSVRC2012 dataset has 1000 classes, 1000 training samples per class and 50 validation samples per class.

We are using 0.9 to compress the model by 10%.\n",

This number denotes the different compression ratios tried by the AIMET for each layer. We are using 3 here which translates to  0.33, 0.66 and 1.00 compression ratios at each layer. Optimal value is 10. The higher the number of candidates the more granular the measurements for each layer, but also the higher the time taken to complete these measurements.\n",

The regression is done with this many random samples. The number of samples used in the layer-by-layer reconstruction procedure.

So there is a trade-off to be considered. We suggest disabling this by default.\n",

Good starting points are to use a learning rate on the same order as the ending learning rate when training the original model, and to drop the learning rate by a factor of 10 every 5 epochs or so.\n",
