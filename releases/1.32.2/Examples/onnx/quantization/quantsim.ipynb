Quantsim is an AIMET feature that adds quantization simulation ops (also called fake quantization ops sometimes) to a trained ML model in order to compute quantization encodings and estimate the resulting accuracy of the model when deployed on quantized ML accelerators.\n",

Also, optimization techniques such as Quantization-Aware Training, AdaRound, and Cross-Layer Equalization can be employed to improve the accuracy of quantized models."

Doing so results in an inferences/sec speedup since unnecessary computation is avoided. Now from a floating point compute perspective, a BN-folded model is mathematically equivalent to a model with BN layers from an inference perspective, and produces the same accuracy. However, folding the BN layers can increase the range of the tensor values for the weight parameters of the adjacent layers. And this can have a negative impact on the quantized accuracy of the model (especially when using INT8 or lower precision). So, we want to simulate that on-target behavior by doing BN folding here.\n",
